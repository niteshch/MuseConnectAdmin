Muse Connect Admin
==================
There are very few websites that connect people to musicians and musicians with each other. However, these websites lack some key functionalities like allowing agencies and enthusiasts to discover local as well as global talent through a single interface and providing musicians a platform to come together and make something magical. We intend to bridge this gap through our application MuseConnect.

This is an admin tool that is developed to help the administrator perform CRUD operations on a Postgres database of MuseConnect.

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Python Flask for web application
- SQLAlchemy for query processing
- Postgresql for storing the data
- Jquery for ajax calls
- Bootstrap for responsive UI

How To Run
----------
Please install Postgresql database. Run the createSchema.sql file on postgres. Launch the application using python server.py command.
